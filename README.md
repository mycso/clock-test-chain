### `npm  i` 

### `npm start` 

### CHALLENGE: to create a single page React app which displays 3

traditional analogue clocks, each showing a different countries timezone. (one being the UK)

 

### Minimum Deliverable:

* user sees all 3 clocks at the same time

* each clock has a hand for hours, minutes, seconds

* one clock should always show UK time

* the other 2 clocks should show the times of 2 other countries/city timezones

* the UK clock should be dominant on the page

* Each individual clock should alert the user whenever its time is on the hour, 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock etc

* source code should be committed to a public git repository and shared

* repo should include instructions how to install and run locally
